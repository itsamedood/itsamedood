# My commissions for Discord bots are open!
> # **Details**
> • Every extra command is **\$1**.
>
> • Every extra event is **\$1**.
>
> • Commands will be made private by default, meaning the bot will only work in the server it's already in, however, I can make them public if you want, just ask!
>
> • If you want database integration, that'll be an extra **\$5**. It will be with `MongoDB` since that's the only database I know how to use.
>
> • The bot will be written in **TypeScript**, using **discord.js** by default, however, I can write it in **JavaScript** or **Python** and use **Pycord** if you'd (for some reason) rather me do.
>
> • I can only accept payment through **Cash App** at this time, my cash tag is `$itsamedood`. I will show screenshots and clips of the code, the bot running, as well as it working. Once you pay, you will receive the entire bot all zipped together nicely!
>
> • Advanced systems, such as an economy, giveaway, or ticket system will cost anywhere from **\$10** to **\$15** since they are complicated and take a lot of time to write and test.
>
> • Notification systems for something like YouTube or Twitch will cost **\$5** because they're not really that complicated.
>
> ### • Most importantly: ***PLEASE BE PATIENT!!!*** This stuff takes time, it's not going to be done in 10 minutes, it may take a day to complete a simple one, yet week(s) to complete a more complex one!
